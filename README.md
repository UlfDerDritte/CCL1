## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme wasn't too hard to get done once I got going.
- **Core Mechanics:** The movement and shooting came together without much issue. Figuring out and implementing cooldowns for shooting and taking damage was fun. 

### Challenges:
- **Code:** I couldn't get everything I had plannet into the game cause I ran out of time, which is the reason for the static background and the lack of more levels since I ran out of time to make more enemies.
- **Sprites:** I underestimated the time it would take to finish making the artwork for the game, scrambling to get it all done in time.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Time Managment:** I need to improve my time managment and make more concrete plans from the start to have a rough timeframe for things to add.
- **Art:** Creating better placeholder sprites, such as static versions of the finished ones could have been helpful in finding inspiration for mechanics.
