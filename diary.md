13.1. Had the Introduction and the initial discussion today, setup the initial skeleton of the code
14.1. working on the code skeleton more, setting up actual objects, starting with collision
15.1. collision working, but no effects implemented yet, adding more placeholder textures adding finish line object which will be what wins you the game on collision at some point
16.1. implementing projectiles spawning, health framework
17.1. doing collision for projectiles, adding enemy object

20.1. finishing up some code, rewriting some triggers, miscellaneous stuff generally, working on a bunch of different stuff
21.1. implementing collision logic for projectiles and enemies. some mechanics for what happens when the finish truffle is in sight
22.1. setting up enemy movement and doing some sprite work
23.1. more sprite work, implementing collision between enemies and rocks, tying game into start, lose and win screens, finishing touches, coming to terms with my own mortality
